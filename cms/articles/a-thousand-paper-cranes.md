It’s July 1945, and war devastates half the planet. Casualty numbers climb into the tens of millions. America, the United Kingdom, and China collectively demand that Japan surrender, or face “prompt and utter destruction.” Japan refuses. In a few weeks, America brings the promised atomic apocalypse to Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

In Hiroshima, brilliant light floods the sky, followed by thunderous booming. 30 percent of civilians are killed instantly by the blast and subsequent firestorm. Another 30 percent or so are left injured. When the sky falls, it is black and radioactive. Japan surrenders three days later.

The full impact of the A-bomb is invisible. Radiation-induced cancer has a minimum latency period of five years. Some devastations are ear-splitting; this one stays quiet. One unforeseen victim is Sadako Sasaki, a twelve-year-old girl diagnosed with leukemia in 1955. During her hospital stay, she takes a vested interest in origami, making hundreds upon hundreds of paper cranes in the span of a few months. Legend states that anyone who folds a thousand cranes will have a wish fulfilled by the gods, and she wants to live. We all do.

Origami has roots in both the Allied and Axis powers. Some historians contend it bloomed from Chinese paper-folding; others insist the art form originated from religious ceremonial practices in Japan. Still, it’s not until the nineteenth century that the mathematics of origami becomes a topic of wide interest.

There are seven axioms that govern its underpinnings. The first is straightforward enough. Take a piece of paper, choose any two distinct points, and there is some unique fold that passes through both. The second axiom: take the same piece of paper, choose any two distinct points, and there is a unique fold that places one onto the other.

The rest of the axioms follow in similar fashion. Maybe all this is to say, like the points on the paper—no matter how far apart we are, we will always be more connected than we think.

Every high school freshman is familiar with the classical tools of geometry: the straightedge and compass. One for edges and one for curves.The universe of a ninth-grade math classroom can be spun with two instruments.

But not every geometric question can be answered with these two instruments. Take the Delian problem. Here’s how the story goes. Citizens of the ancient island of Delos—a small barren rock nestled in the Aegean sea—consult the Oracle of Delphi. They’re desperate; an apocalyptic plague sent down by Apollo has decimated their population. In response, the Oracle informs them that they must double the size of their altar, a regular cube, to Apollo. A trio of ancient mathematicians—Eudoxus, Archytas, Menaechmus—discover solutions, but not through geometric means. They are reprimanded by Plato, but he, too, cannot solve the riddle.

Thousands of years later, in 1837, French mathematician Pierre Wantzel proves that it is impossible to double a cube with only a straightedge and compass.So we turn to origami, which makes quick work of the task. First, fold a square into thirds. Next, sweep the bottom-left corner up to meet the right edge, so the two—thirds line brushes against the one-third line. (See the diagram below.) The point where corner meets edge divides the side of the square, such that a cube with an edge the length of the longer portion will be double the volume of a cube with an edge the length of the shorter portion.
